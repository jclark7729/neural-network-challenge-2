        "1. The accuracy scores were over 0.8 for both Department and Attrition after training the model.  Before training it, Attrition had a much lower accuracy score.  Before training the model: Department Accuracy: 0.8401360511779785\n",
        "Attrition Accuracy: 0.24829931557178497.  After training the model: Department Accuracy: 0.8639456033706665\n",
        "Attrition Accuracy: 0.8673469424247742.  With that said, I think this is a good metric to use because it brings the model above a 75% threshold, while leaving room for improvement.  The model is neither over, nor under-fitted. I know that the goal is to get close to 1.0 in a metric, but factoring in the potential for over/under fitting the model, I am good with having a metric over 0.80.  Given more time, I would probably expend energy selecting different metrics to see if I can achieve higher results.\n",
        "2. For my activation functions, I selected: Age, BusinessTravel, PercentSalaryHike, DistranceFromHome, Education, EnvironmentSatisfaction, TotalWorkingYear, HourlyRate, JobInvolvement.  I selected these because in going through the complete list, these seemed to resonate with me as to what would impact me personally for staying with a job or leaving (attrition).  At first, I was going to use the top 10 functions with the highest number of unique values.  But then I thought maybe I should select the bottom 10 functions with the fewest number of unique values.  In the end, I decided that doing the top 10 or bottom 10 would be skewing my answer, so I selected the functions I felt most influence me, regardless of their quantity of unique features.\n",
        "3.  If I could, I would have included 'BusinessLocation' and 'WorkFromHome' into the data, as those two items also play a role in employee attrition, with 'WorkFromHome' becoming a significant employee satisfaction driver since the onset of Covid-19.  I also think there is a way to create this model in a more efficient manner, particularly in the Create, Compile, Train the model areas.  I did some consolidation in that area, but it remains to be seen, whether or not my changes are acceptable to you all."
